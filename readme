1. C# Design Patterns : Memento Pattern
    - Undo Redo Pattern
    - dotnet add package newtonsoft.json
    - caretaker.cs same state manager in memento

2. C# Design Patterns : State Pattern
    - change state of object follow status
    - open for extension
    - close for modification
     
3. C# Design Patterns : Iterator Pattern
    - list or array when object within change code will not change
    - not loop access element but loop interface level
    - user use application abstract level

4. C# Design Patterns : Iterator Pattern by implement IEnumerable and IEnumerator netcore c#8.0 
    - call property from for each loop
    - using implement interface IEnumerable
    - create IEnumerator nested class for access private property 

5. C# Design Patterns : Strategy Pattern
    - separate algorithm with object
    - separate algorithm from class and shared algorithm between class

6. C# Design Patterns : Command Pattern
    - corrective problem about library 2 package designer of framework can not know class that design will used to work for?
    - use case undo redo in command pattern compare memento pattern
        // resize 1080p => 720p 
        // memento : Keep picture 1080p, 720p
        // command : Keep resolution before, after

7. C# Design Patterns : Template Method Pattern
    - control writing method for the team write method same body such as logging before start method or cleanup after method work
